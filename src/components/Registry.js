					What we want most for our wedding is to have all of our friends and family there to celebrate the occasion with us, and so, more than anything we would simply enjoy your presence. (We mean it!) That said, we also enjoy going on vactions to sunny places around the globe, therefore we'll take cash, checks, venmo and paypal
